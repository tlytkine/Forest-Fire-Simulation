<h2><u>Bio:</u></h2>

<p> My full name is Timothy Lytkine but everyone calls me Tim. I was born and raised in NYC but currently I'm a sophomore at GW. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, reading books, spending time with friends and traveling the world. I'm majoring in Computer Science because I find the variety of applications it has to be fascinating. I am also minoring in Economics which is allowing me to have a better understanding of how the world works. </b> </p>
